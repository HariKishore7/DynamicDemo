Project Expalnation:

On the page rendering in the UI the form will render.

If we fill the form with some data in all the fields it will show the information on the alert.

If we miss any of the field, it will give an alert like "Please fill all fields before submitting"

If we fill fill any field and tries to remove that field, it will print in that below field as "Field is required."

I have used Bootstrap to make the page responsive.
